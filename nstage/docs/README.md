# N-Stage Rocket Optimization

This repository provides various numerical solvers for optimizing delta-V distribution in a multi-stage rocket.

## Features
- Supports **Newton's Method**, **Bisection**, **Secant**, **SciPy root-finding**, and **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.
- Benchmarks different solvers for performance comparison.

## Installation
Requires Python 3 and the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy scipy deap
```

## Usage
To run the solver:
```sh
python benchmark.py
```
