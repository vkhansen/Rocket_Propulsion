# How to Use the Rocket Optimization Solver

## Running the Optimization
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `python benchmark.py` to see a comparison of different solvers.
3. Modify `nstage.py` to adjust rocket parameters.

## Adding New Solvers
- Modify `Nstage` in `nstage.py` to include additional optimization algorithms.
